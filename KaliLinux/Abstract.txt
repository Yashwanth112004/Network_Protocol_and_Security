Abstract for the Project on Web Phishing using Mass Mailer Attack
Web phishing is a prevalent cyber-attack technique aimed at deceiving individuals into disclosing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal information. 
Among the various methods employed by attackers, the mass mailer attack stands out for its widespread impact. 
In a mass mailer attack, phishing emails are sent to a large number of recipients with the intent of tricking them into interacting with malicious content, such as links to fraudulent websites.
This project explores the mechanics of a mass mailer-based phishing attack, focusing on its implementation, detection, and prevention. 
The primary goal is to simulate a phishing campaign using a mass mailer attack to demonstrate how attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in human behaviour and network security.
Key areas covered include:
1.	Email Spoofing and Automation: Utilizing mass mailing tools to simulate phishing emails with convincing content, such as fake login pages or requests for personal information.
2.	Targeting Techniques: Investigating how attackers select and target victims through social engineering techniques to increase the effectiveness of phishing campaigns.
3.	Detection Mechanisms: Analysing how automated systems and users can detect phishing attempts through features like suspicious URLs, email headers, and content patterns.
4.	Security Solutions: Presenting strategies to defend against phishing, including the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure email gateways, and employee education.
The outcomes of this project are expected to raise awareness about the dangers of phishing and provide insight into cybersecurity defences against mass mailer-based attacks. 
It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the attack lifecycle, along with hands-on experience in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques.
